\title{Crude Oil Term Structure Futures Data (1990 - 1995)}
\format{
A \code{list} Containing eight objects:

\describe{
 \item{contracts}{A data frame with 268 rows and 82 columns. Each column represents a Crude Oil futures contract, and each row represents a closing
weekly price for that futures contract. Observation dates of the contract object are weekly in frequency from
\code{1990-02-06} to \code{1995-02-14}. Contracts without observations on a particular date are represented as \code{NA}.}
 \item{stitched_futures}{Schwartz and Smith (2000) applied stitched contract observation data to estimate commodity pricing models, which
are approximated within this object. The \code{stitched_futures} object was developed using the \code{stitch_contracts} function (see \code{stitch_contracts} examples for more details). Contracts were
stitched according to the contract numbers
specified within the object \code{stitched_TTM}. \code{stitched_futures} is
identical to the futures data made available within the MATLAB program "SchwartzSmithModel" developed by Goodwin (2013).}
 \item{spot}{A \code{data.frame} of spot prices of Crude Oil. weekly in frequency from
\code{1990-02-06} to \code{1995-02-14}.}
 \item{final_trading_days}{Named vector listing the final trading days of each observed futures contract within the \code{contracts} object. Each element of
\code{final_trading_days} corresponds to a column of the \code{contracts} object. The final
trading day of a futures contract is used to calculate the number of business
days from a given observation to the maturity of the contract (ie. a contract time to maturity).}
 \item{contract_maturities}{A data frame with identical dimensions to the \code{contracts} data frame. This data frame
lists the time to maturity of a given futures contract in years at each observation point.
This is identical to the number of business days (in years) between the observed date and the final trading day of a particular futures contract.
The maturity matrix assumes 262 trading days a year. If the contract is not yet available or has expired, the \code{contract_maturities} element is \code{NA}.}
 \item{stitched_TTM}{A vector corresponding to the constant time to maturities that was
assumed within the original study of Schwartz and Smith (2000).}
 \item{dt}{The discrete time step used to estimate parameters with this data. The time step is 5/262, which represents a
weekly frequency of observations where each weekday is a business day (ie. there are no business days on weekends).}
 \item{two_factor}{The crude oil two-factor commodity pricing model parameters presented within the work of Schwartz and Smith (2000).
These parameter estimates are prolific, benchmarked within several subsequent publications.}

\description{
The \code{SS_oil} \code{list} object features the approximate weekly observations of Crude Oil (WTI) futures contracts used to develop a two-factor
commodity pricing model within the prominent work of Schwartz and Smith (2000) titled: "Short-Term Variations and long-Term Dynamics in Commodity Prices".
The two-factor commodity pricing model presented within this study is also included. The \code{SS_oil} list object is used extensively within the
\code{NFCP} package to provide working examples and showcase the features of the package.
