\value{
The 'American.Option.Value' function by default returns a \code{numeric} object corresponding to the calculated value of the American put option.

When \code{verbose = T}, 6 objects are returned within a \code{list} class object. The objects returned are:

\tabular{ll}{

\code{Value} \tab The calculated option value. \cr
\code{Standard Error} \tab The standard error of the calculated option value. \cr
\code{Expected Timing} \tab The expected time of early exercise.. \cr
\code{Expected Timing SE} \tab The standard error of the expected time of early exercise. \cr
\code{Exercise Probability} \tab The probability of early exercise of the option being exercised. \cr
\code{Cumulative Exercise Probability} \tab \code{vector}. The cumulative probability of option exercise at each discrete observation point \cr
}

When \code{debugging = T}, an additional 2 objects are returned within the \code{list} class object. These are the results output by both the 'Spot.Price.Simulate' and
'LSM.AmericanOption' of the 'LSMRealOptions' package respectively. The objects returned are:

\tabular{ll}{
\code{State_Variables} \tab A matrix of simulated state variables for each factor is returned when \code{verbose = T}. The number of factors returned corresponds to the number of factors in the specified N-factor model. \cr
\code{Prices} \tab A matrix of simulated price paths. Each column represents one simulated price path and each row represents one simulated observation. \cr

\details{
The 'American.Option.Value' function is a wrapper to the 'Spot.Price.Simulate' and 'LSM.AmericanOption' of the 'LSMRealOptions' package that
returns the value of American put options under a given N-factor model.

The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation method is an option valuation method first presented by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) that
approximates the value of American options.

Methods to solve for the value of options with early exercise opportunities include partial differential equations, lattice-based methods
and Monte-Carlo simulation. LSM simulation is the optimal solution method to value American options under an N-factor model due
to the multiple factors that can make up the spot price process and influence the option value. Whilst lattice and partial differential equation
approaches suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality', LSM simulation may be readily applied under multi-factor settings.

Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) state that as the conditional expectation of the continuation value belongs to a Hilbert space,
it can be represented by a combination of orthogonal basis functions. Increasing the number of stochastic state variables
therefore increases the number of required basis functions exponentially.

\examples{

##Example 1 - An American put option on a stock following 'GBM'
##growing at the risk-free rate:
American.Option.Value(X.0 = log(36),
    parameters = c(mu_star = (0.06 - (1/2) * 0.2^2), sigma_1 = 0.2),
    n = 1e2,
    t = 1,
    dt = 1/50,
    K = 40,
    r = 0.05,
    verbose = FALSE,
    orthogonal = "Laguerre",
    degree = 3)

##Example 2 - An American put option under a two-factor crude oil model:

##Step 1 - Obtain current (i.e. most recent) state vector by filtering the
##two-factor oil model:
Schwartz.Smith.Oil <- NFCP.Kalman.filter(parameter.values = SS.Oil$Two.Factor,
                                        parameters = names(SS.Oil$Two.Factor),
                                        log.futures = log(SS.Oil$Stitched.Futures),
                                        dt = SS.Oil$dt,
                                        TTM = SS.Oil$Stitched.TTM,
                                        verbose = TRUE)

##Step 2 - Calculate 'put' option price:
American.Option.Value(X.0 = Schwartz.Smith.Oil$X.t,
                     parameters = SS.Oil$Two.Factor,
                     n = 1e2,
                     t = 1,
                     dt = 1/12,
                     K = 20,
                     r = 0.05,
                     verbose = FALSE,
                     orthogonal = "Power",
                     degree = 2)
